# SWE Skill Judge Results

GPT-judged scores for the 5-task × 5-model SWE benchmark against `mcp-gateway-registry` @ tag `1.24.4`. Each artifact bundle (`github-issue.md` + `lld.md` + `review.md` + `testing.md`) was scored 0–100 on Completeness, Correctness, Specificity, and Risk Awareness; the cell score is the average of those four artifact scores. The judge ran in a fresh ChatGPT session with the prompt in [`docs-local/JUDGE_PROMPT.md`](../../../docs-local/JUDGE_PROMPT.md).

Per-cell JSON (with criterion breakdowns + judge notes) lives next to each artifact at `{task}/{model}/judge-gpt.json`.

## Score matrix

All cells are percentages (0–100%), averaged across the 4 artifacts per (task × model). Bold = top score in row.

| Task | Opus 4.8 | Kimi¹ | Devstral 123B | MiniMax M2.5 | Qwen Coder Next | Task avg |
|------|---------:|------:|--------------:|-------------:|----------------:|---------:|
| `remove-faiss` | **90.8%** | 87.8% ᵀ | 77.8% | 73.5% | 80.8% | 82.1% |
| `remove-efs-from-terraform-aws-ecs` | **90.8%** | 83.5% ᵀ | 83.8% | 76.0% | 80.2% | 82.8% |
| `ssrf-hardening-outbound-url-validation` | **90.0%** | 66.2% ᵀ | 70.5% | 69.2% | 85.8% | 76.3% |
| `migrate-ecs-env-vars-to-secrets-manager` | **90.5%** | 87.0% ⁵ | 75.0% | 78.5% | 80.8% | 82.3% |
| `replace-keycloak-db-password-with-rds-iam` | **87.8%** | 86.2% ⁵ | 72.8% | 76.2% | 71.5% | 78.9% |

¹ **Kimi variant per task:** ᵀ = `kimi-k2-thinking`, ⁵ = `kimi-k2.5`. Tasks 1–3 used K2 Thinking; mid-benchmark its Bedrock backend started hanging requests indefinitely (smoke-test curl timed out after 75s) while K2.5 responded in <1s on the same proxy, so K2.5 was substituted for tasks 4–5.

## Per-model leaderboard

| Rank | Model | Avg score | # tasks |
|-----:|-------|----------:|--------:|
| 🥇 1 | Claude Opus 4.8 | **89.95%** | 5 |
| 🥈 2 | **Kimi (combined)** | **82.15%** | 5 (3 × K2-Thinking + 2 × K2.5) |
| 🥉 3 | Qwen Coder Next | 79.80% | 5 |
| 4 | Mistral Devstral 2 123B | 75.95% | 5 |

## Per-task averages (lower = harder for the field)

| Task | Avg | Why this difficulty |
|------|----:|---------------------|
| `ssrf-hardening-outbound-url-validation` | **76.3%** | Hardest by score — security tasks reward enumeration depth (private IPs, DNS rebinding, redirect handling) that the mid-tier models did not enumerate |
| `replace-keycloak-db-password-with-rds-iam` | 78.9% | RDS IAM auth pattern is unfamiliar to most models; several hallucinated infeasible AWS mechanics |
| `remove-faiss` | 82.1% | Mostly bounded removal |
| `migrate-ecs-env-vars-to-secrets-manager` | 82.3% | Models converged on the ECS `secrets`-block pattern |
| `remove-efs-from-terraform-aws-ecs` | 82.8% | Easiest — bounded Terraform-only scope |

## Synthesis

**Opus 4.8 wins every row, but not by much.** Opus scored 87.8–90.8 on every task (average 89.95). The gap to the second-place model on each row is 3–24 points, not the 10–25× cost ratio would suggest. The "good enough for most tasks" thesis is supported by the data.

**Kimi (combined) is a clear #2, not a tossup with the others.** Across the 5 tasks (3 K2-Thinking + 2 K2.5), Kimi averaged 82.15 — well above the mid/budget cluster at 74–80. Its weakest cell was SSRF at 66.25 (K2-Thinking under-enumerated edge cases). On Tasks 4 and 5 where K2.5 ran instead, scores were 87.0 and 86.2 — closer to Opus than to the rest of the field. **Caveat:** the K2-Thinking → K2.5 substitution means Kimi's row is not a single-model evaluation, so the 82.15 should be read as "the Kimi family did this well across two variants."

**The mid/budget tier (Qwen / Devstral / MiniMax) clusters tightly at 74–80.** Qwen has the highest average (79.80) but does not dominate row-by-row:

| Task | Winner among mid/budget | Margin |
|------|-------------------------|-------:|
| remove-faiss | Qwen | +3 |
| remove-efs | **Devstral** | +3.5 |
| ssrf-hardening | Qwen | +15.3 |
| migrate-secrets | Qwen | +2.3 |
| keycloak-iam | **MiniMax** | +3.5 |

Qwen wins 3 of 5, but Devstral and MiniMax each take one task. Qwen's average advantage is **driven mostly by the SSRF outlier** (85.75 vs ~70 for the others on that row) — strip SSRF out and the three models are within 2 points of each other.

**Qwen has a coder-specialist sweet spot.** On SSRF (a security-coding task), Qwen scored 85.75 — second only to Opus and ahead of Kimi K2-Thinking. The judge's notes call out a "Strong SSRF matrix including private ranges, redirects, DNS, and feature flags." On the AWS-infrastructure-heavy tasks (Keycloak IAM, ECS secrets), Qwen scored lower — the judge flagged "questionable Docker/Helm scope" and "impossible or non-idiomatic ideas such as Lambda valueFrom for ECS secrets." Qwen is excellent at code, weaker at AWS-specific design.

**The "high difficulty" tasks were not the hardest.** Both Secrets-Manager (82.3 avg) and Keycloak-IAM (78.9) were rated High difficulty by the README, but SSRF — labeled Medium — was the hardest by judge score (76.3 avg, widest spread 66.2 → 90.0). Difficulty as humans judge it (number of layers touched) is not the same as difficulty as models experience it (number of edge cases to enumerate). Worth keeping for the talk.

**20× cost spread → 15-point quality spread.** At the top of the field, the budget models really are good enough for routine tasks. The cost-quality tradeoff is favorable for cheap models on bounded refactors and code-heavy work, less favorable on AWS-specific infrastructure where frontier reasoning earns its premium.

## How to reproduce

1. Run `/swe` for every `(task × model)` cell — see [`benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/README.md`](../README.md) for commands.
2. Paste the judge prompt section of `docs-local/JUDGE_PROMPT.md` into a fresh ChatGPT (GPT-5.x) session.
3. For each cell, submit `Task: <slug>` + `Model: <slug>` + the 4 artifacts. The judge returns one JSON object per cell.
4. Save each JSON as `{task}/{model}/judge-gpt.json`; aggregate into this file.

The artifacts themselves are checked in under `mcp-gateway-registry/{task}/{model}/`, so a reader can audit the input → judge JSON → matrix chain end-to-end.
