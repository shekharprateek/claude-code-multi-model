# Judge Results

Scores are 0-100 task averages from the four artifact totals in each `eval.json`.

## Synthesis

**Opus 4.8 wins every row except one** (Kimi K2-Thinking edges it on remove-faiss with 90.50 vs 89.00). The gap to second place is 3.85 points — meaningful but not insurmountable.

**Kimi K2 (Bedrock) vs Kimi-K2.7-Code (self-hosted):** The Bedrock-hosted K2 scored 84.60 vs the self-hosted K2.7-Code at 73.60 — an 11-point gap on the same model family. This likely reflects infrastructure issues during the self-hosted run (context overflow, tool-call parser problems, subagent routing failures) rather than raw model capability.

**Self-hosted frontier models (GLM-5.2, Kimi-K2.7-Code) landed mid-pack**, not at the frontier tier their parameter counts suggest. Both scored 73.60 — below even Qwen Coder Next (76.95) which ran via managed Bedrock with zero infrastructure friction. The serving complexity (context management, thinking parsers, CUDA compilation) penalized the self-hosted path.

**Difficulty tiers held:** remove-efs and remove-faiss (bounded cleanup, enumerable surfaces) were easiest. SSRF was moderate. Secrets Manager and RDS IAM were hardest — punishing models that hallucinated AWS patterns or hand-waved Keycloak internals.

**The budget tier is genuinely capable:** Qwen 3.6 35B (a 3B-active MoE on a $4.50/hr instance) scored 74.65 — within 1 point of frontier-class 744B and 1,058B models on $55-85/hr hardware. For bounded tasks, the cost/quality tradeoff strongly favors smaller self-hosted models.
