## Overview

This repository does **two** things, in this order:

1. **Run [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) against
   non-Anthropic models.** Claude Code is Anthropic's command-line coding agent;
   by default it talks only to Anthropic's own models. Here it's wired up to
   any of 45 foundation models on Amazon Bedrock (Qwen, DeepSeek, Kimi, MiniMax,
   Mistral, GPT-OSS, GLM, Gemma, Nemotron, Palmyra, plus the 7 native Anthropic
   models), or to any open-source model you self-host on an EC2 GPU instance.
2. **Measure how well each of those models actually does coding work.** Once you
   can swap models freely, the next question is: which model is good enough for
   which task? The repo ships two complementary evaluation modes — a per-task
   *Software Engineering* benchmark you point at any GitHub repo, and a single-
   function *HumanEval* benchmark with published cross-model results.

The first half is plumbing; the second is what makes the plumbing decision-grade.

### How it runs Claude Code on non-Anthropic models

Without modifying Claude Code. Claude Code speaks the Anthropic Messages API;
most Bedrock models speak the OpenAI Chat Completions API. A small
[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) proxy sits in between and translates
the two, so Claude Code "just works" with whichever model you select. Native
Anthropic models on Bedrock are called directly, with no proxy.

Two deployment paths are provided:

| Path | Models | Cost Model | Best For |
|------|--------|------------|----------|
| [**Bedrock**](bedrock/) | 45 models from 12 providers | Pay-per-token | Model variety, zero infrastructure |
| [**Self-Hosted (EC2)**](self-hosted/) | Any Ollama/vLLM model | Fixed hourly GPU cost | Data sovereignty, air-gapped, unlimited tokens |

### How it measures the models

Two evaluation modes ship with the repo. Pick the one that matches the question
you're trying to answer:

| Mode | What it measures | Where the work lives |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| **[SWE skill](#evaluation-1--swe-skill-real-world-tasks)** (real-world tasks) | Can the model take a real software-engineering problem in a real repo from idea to a complete design package — GitHub issue spec, low-level design, expert review, testing plan? | [.claude/skills/swe/](.claude/skills/swe/) → produces artifacts under [benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/](benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/) |
| **[HumanEval](#evaluation-2--humaneval-single-function-pass1)** (single-function pass@1) | On 164 small self-contained Python tasks, does the model emit a function body that passes the hidden unit tests? | [bedrock/benchmark/humaneval_runner.py](bedrock/benchmark/humaneval_runner.py) |

> **"SWE" here means software engineering in general — not [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/),
> the specific benchmark dataset.** The skill in this repo lets you run any model
> against any task in any repo of your choosing. It is a *harness*, not a fixed
> benchmark set. Compare results across models on the same task, or compare a
> single model across tasks of varying difficulty.

**What you get end to end:**

- Run Claude Code with **45 Bedrock models** (7 native Anthropic + 38 third-party via Bedrock), or any open-source model you self-host on EC2
- A one-command **LiteLLM proxy** that handles Anthropic↔OpenAI translation, tool calling, and streaming
- An interactive **model picker** and per-model launch scripts
- A **`/swe` skill** for repo-grounded SWE benchmarking, plus a **`/summarize`** skill for after-action reporting (token usage, errors, themes per run)
- A reproducible **HumanEval benchmark** with cross-model pass@1 + per-token-cost numbers

```

Anthropic models go **direct** to Bedrock — no proxy needed since both speak
the Anthropic Messages format. Third-party models go through the **LiteLLM
proxy**, which translates the Anthropic Messages format Claude Code speaks
into the OpenAI Chat Completions format those models expose on Bedrock.

### Self-hosted path

       │   ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=         │

                      ▼
       ┌───────────────────────────────┐

       └───────────────────────────────┘
```

Claude Code is pointed at `localhost`; the SSH tunnel transparently forwards
every request to Ollama on the EC2 instance. No public ingress, no API keys
— the only network path in is SSH.

## Why this repo exists, briefly

A coding agent session is token-heavy: tool calls, file reads, edits, and
reasoning steps all consume input and output tokens. On Amazon Bedrock, frontier
models cost roughly **5–20× more per token** than the cheapest non-Anthropic
models on the same endpoint. Running every task on a frontier model is the most
expensive default; running every task on the cheapest model risks worse output.

The interesting question is *how much quality you actually lose* by routing
routine tasks to a cheaper model — and that depends on the task and the model.
The two evaluation modes below exist to make that question answerable with
data, not opinion.

## Evaluation 1 — SWE skill (real-world tasks)

The `/swe` skill runs Claude Code (backed by whichever model you've selected)
through a real software-engineering task in a real repository, and lands four
artifacts on disk that capture the model's reasoning end-to-end. The artifacts
are designed to be read by either a human reviewer or a separate LLM-as-judge.

**Pipeline per run:**

```
{any-github-repo} ──► /swe ──► benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/
                                  └─ {repo-name}/
                                      └─ {problem-name}/
                                          └─ {model-name}/
                                              ├─ github-issue.md   # spec
                                              ├─ lld.md            # design
                                              ├─ review.md         # critique
                                              └─ testing.md        # test plan
```

The skill **stops at design**. It does not modify production code, run tests,
or open PRs. Whether the design is any good is a downstream evaluation step you
control: read the artifacts yourself, or feed them to another LLM judge.

A second skill, `/summarize`, runs *after* `/swe` and produces a per-run report
covering artifact completeness, error signals from the session, token usage
broken down by model and cache type, and recurring themes from the conversation.
Useful when you're comparing many model+task combinations and don't want to eyeball
every transcript.

### Worked example: `mcp-gateway-registry`

The repo ships a worked example so you can see the harness producing real
artifacts before pointing it at your own code. The example target is
[agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry)
at tag `1.24.4`, with two problems scoped:

| Problem | What the model has to do |
|---|---|
| `remove-faiss` | Find and remove every FAISS reference (imports, deps, config, docs) and verify nothing breaks |
| `remove-efs-from-terraform-aws-ecs` | Strip EFS out of `terraform/aws-ecs/` (file system, mount targets, security groups, task-definition mounts), keep `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` green |

Two models already have artifacts on the first problem
(`qwen.qwen3-coder-next` and `qwen.qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct`) so you can
compare them side-by-side without running the skill yourself. Setup, task
descriptions, and per-model invocation steps are in
[benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/README.md](benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/README.md).

> **The example repo is the example, not the contract.** `/swe` works against
> any GitHub URL — clone the target you actually care about, write the task
> description, and run.

> **Important — "SWE" ≠ [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/).** This skill
> evaluates a model on *whatever problem you give it in whatever repo you point
> it at*, and the output is artifacts you grade. SWE-bench is a fixed dataset
> of GitHub issues with hidden test patches that grade themselves. The two are
> complementary, not interchangeable.

## Evaluation 2 — HumanEval (single-function pass@1)

We measured model quality on the public [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)
benchmark (164 tasks), driving each task through Claude Code backed by each model
and scoring with standard `pass@1`:

| Model | pass@1 | Input $/1M | Output $/1M |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 97.6% | $3.00 | $15.00 |
| Kimi K2.5 | 96.3% | $0.60 | $3.00 |
| DeepSeek V3.2 | 94.5% | $0.62 | $1.85 |
| Qwen Coder Next | 91.5% | $0.50 | $1.20 |
| Qwen Coder 30B | 90.9% | $0.15 | $0.62 |

Budget models reach 93–99% of the frontier model's pass rate at a fraction of
the cost. Prices are on-demand Standard-tier rates for US East from the
[Amazon Bedrock pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) at the
time of writing. Full method, caveats, and reproduce steps in
[bedrock/README.md](bedrock/README.md#benchmark-humaneval).

> **HumanEval is single-function code generation, not agentic editing.**
> Frontier models score 95%+ on HumanEval but only 40–80% on SWE-bench.
> Use HumanEval as a quick quality signal for picking a routing tier; use the
> SWE skill above (or your own production traffic) when you need to know whether
> a model can actually navigate a real codebase.

## Prerequisites

- An **AWS account** with [Amazon Bedrock model access](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess) enabled for the models you want to use
- **AWS credentials** configured locally (`aws configure`, an IAM role, or AWS SSO)
- **[Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** installed
- **Python 3.9+** (for the LiteLLM proxy and Bedrock token generation)
- For the self-hosted path: permission to launch an **EC2 GPU instance** (e.g. `g6e.xlarge`)

> The OpenAI-compatible Bedrock endpoint used for third-party models is currently available in **`us-east-1`**.

## Get Started

Pick a path that matches what you're trying to do.

**Just want to run a non-Anthropic model through Claude Code?**

- **[bedrock/README.md](bedrock/README.md)** — Bedrock path. Start the LiteLLM
  proxy and run Claude Code against any of the 45 models with `claude-model.sh`.
- **[self-hosted/README.md](self-hosted/README.md)** — Self-hosted path. Provision
  a GPU instance, install Ollama, open an SSH tunnel, and run Claude Code against
  a model in your VPC.

**Want to benchmark a model on a real repo task?**

- **[benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/README.md](benchmarks/swe-benchmark-data/README.md)** —
  Set up the example target (`mcp-gateway-registry`) or any GitHub repo of your
  choosing, then invoke `/swe` from Claude Code. The skill produces four
  artifacts per (problem, model) pair, ready for human or LLM-judge review.

**Want the published HumanEval cross-model numbers?**

- See the [Evaluation 2 — HumanEval](#evaluation-2--humaneval-single-function-pass1)
  table above; full method and reproduce steps in
  [bedrock/README.md](bedrock/README.md#benchmark-humaneval).

## Comparison

| | Bedrock | Self-Hosted (EC2) |
|---|---|---|
| **Models** | 45 from 12 providers | Any GGUF/HF model |
| **Pricing** | Per-token ($0.15-$15/M) | Per-hour ($0.84-$4.60/hr GPU) |
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | 15-20 minutes |
| **Latency** | Varies by model (a few sec to minutes/task) | Depends on GPU + model size |
| **Data location** | AWS Bedrock service | Your VPC, your instance |
| **Best when** | Variable workload, model variety | Fixed workload, data sovereignty |
| **Break-even** | < ~2M tokens/hour | > ~2M tokens/hour |
